{"contexts": ["my brother unexpectedly passed away on xxxxxxxx we did not have access to his financial records regarding his auto loan with honda financial services as he was receiving statements and other correspondence electronically no one in our family had access to his email or knows his email account password we never received written notice in the mail from honda financial services   honda   to attempt to settle the past due loan which i found odd as lenders generally send written notice to the account address on record to collect a debt i was trying to find the lender when the car registration was due but the dmv could not disclose the information his employer notified me on xxxxxxxx that honda called their office and gave me the number to call i called honda on xxxxxxxx and forwarded the death certificate to two different honda email addresses as requested \n\nhonda mailed notices of the amount of the loan balance and our options i requested for additional time as we were planning to sell the car but the prospective buyer needed time to secure financing i explained that to honda but their debt collection department said that the account is past due and we had to make a payment \n\ni requested for copies of statements to verify if the payment amount they were verbally giving me was reasonable honda refused to provide the information because we did not have court documents my brother s estate does not qualify for probate under california law as a result honda would not talk with our family but instead demanded the car or pay the full amount of the loan they gave us no other options the ca dmv has a reg 5 form to transfer title for small estates that do not qualify for probate why dont auto financing companies have such an option or solution for grieving families who could try to pay the loan provided they have proper documentation to make an educated financial decision why do families with small estates have to face discrimination and be treated as a financially undesirable consumer segment with lenders refusing to work with them however the lenders have no issue with imposing their will by preying on our grief over losing a loved one their tactics were akin to a cyberbully demanding a ransom payment in bitcoin or a fraudulent phone caller demanding payment in gift cards i never expected to be at the mercy of such severe bullying tactics from a multinational conglomerate that markets itself as helpful \n\ni was subjected to honda s aggressive and harassing debt collection tactics they treated me as a deadbeat even though i reminded them that i was not their customer i did not sign a covenant with them i did not default on the loan i was trying to work with them but they refused to provide the information our family needed to make an educated financial decision \n\none account manager xxxx xxxx was calling me every day at xxxx xxxx i told her i have no update you just called me 24 hours ago i asked her to mail statements to the account address on record so we can determine if the payment honda was seeking was reasonable but she said that honda doesnt work that way honda does things this way she said her words pretty much told me that they were not going to play fair it was a stark example of a company s hubris and arrogance to bully a consumer and put them at an unfair disadvantage by refusing to be transparent \n\nxxxx xxxx harassing tactics left me in such distress i demanded to speak to a manager or someone in legal who understands the complexity of estates because i was getting nowhere with xxxx xxxx she treated me like i was a deadbeat customer who defaulted on the loan according to xxxx xxxx no managers exist at her company and she is equivalent to the companys ceo she left me with an impression that there is no hierarchy no accountability no recourse for a consumer at honda\n\ni called honda a few minutes later and spoke to xxxx xxxx he was more understanding he said that he also experienced a death and understood the difficulties of settling a loved one s estate he was able to send me the requested statements for my family to review \n\ni spoke to xxxx another account manager on xxxxxxxx at this point she said she was able to speak to me about the account based on information on the death certificate i asked her why the change in treatment i sent the death certificate on xxxxxxxx and 8 out of 10 representatives i have spoken with since then have refused to work with me but they had no issues with bullying and harassing me why didnt they follow the same protocol she did she could not answer my question our family made a monthly payment on xxxxxxxx via xxxx xxxx but we never received a written receipt of the payment from honda \n\nour prospective buyer was able to secure financing so i called honda for a payoff quote on xxxxxxxx i asked for xxxx but she was unavailable so i spoke with xxxx i asked him for a payoff quote but he ignored my request instead he decided to victimize me by giving me another round of honda branded harassment he kept asking me where the car was even though we made a payment a few days ago i told him to stop i am asking for the amount to pay off the loan so we can get this matter over with but he kept harassing when i told him that i will be contacting the consumer financial protection bureau he finally stopped his aggressive bullying tactics by saying that i dont have to threaten him \n\ni spoke to xxxx xxxx another account manager later that day i told her that i apologize if xxxx felt threatened that i was going to tattle to the regulator but he should not have felt threatened if he were complying with rules and regulations of his industry xxxx xxxx provided me with the pay off amount and the check for the full payment was sent on xxxxxxxx \n\nwe have not received any payment confirmations with dollar amounts so we can not account for every charge that was assessed and paid for after my brother died since the last and only statement we were only given was for xxxxxxxx i asked if we would receive written payment confirmations with dollar amounts or a final statement so we can assess if there were any invalid charges and honda said no", "to start this company continues to ignore consumer is original creditor \ncompany continues to use abusive practices under 15 usc 1692a\n\ncompany continues to

checks so i do not know how the process of returning a check works but from what i read it takes a few days so i was prepared to wait until the situation was fixed but several days passed and nothing changed when i contacted usaa once again they said they were still waiting on the funds to be returned and explained to me that both banking institutions have to do their part in order for the process to move along so i contacted my local bank about the situation and they informed me that they were not in the process of returning the check i had deposited you can imagine how confusing this was for

if there were any changes regarding my account and every single person i spoke to told me the same thing   we are waiting for the funds to be returned  i asked to speak to executive members on a few

not appreciate being lied to or taken for a fool if they were concerned about the legitimacy of the check all they had to do was reach out to where it came from to ensure that the check was real even

transaction b  handwriting on item consistent with sample on file and c  account owner s identification was used \nxxxx21  i called the fraud line asking for a  reconsideration  on the claim stating there were three withdrawals that are clearly related and in an area where account holders do not live and do not have any history of activity \nxxxx21  i received a second letter upholding the denial \nxxxx21  i called the fraud line again i asked to speak with the analyst for the case and was told they could make the request i asked if there was an email address that i could send information to the analyst to include in the investigation xxxx provided the email address and i requested another  reconsideration  stating i would send an email with proof that i was not in new york at the time of the withdrawal i asked for another  reconsideration  and stated it was important that i speak to the analyst and the analyst review my email prior to another determination following the call i sent the included email to the general email address noting my claim number the email noted that the activity is clearly suspicious and pointed out the security measures that bank of america advertises to protect against suspicious activity \nxxxx21  my father went through multiple calls and determined that a claim was not initiated for the two withdrawals on his account he started a claim and provided me with his claim number that claim  is xxxx \nxxxx21  i called the fraud number for an update on my claim and was told that it was denied again on xxxx i did not receive a letter or any notification i gave the xxxx the claim number for the fraudulent activity on linked accounts in reviewing the information in the system the xxxx did indicate that the name and identification used in the withdrawal from my account was my father not me the xxxx recommended that the claim on my father s accounts be allowed to proceed to a resolution and call back then they indicated that if that claim was honored

called the fraud number and indicated that the claim on linked accounts regarding associated fraudulent activity was honored and asked for a  reconsideration  given that \nxxxx21  i called for an

though i requested that multiple times all three withdrawals are within a short timeframe from bank locations very close together all go against the account history of transactions and should easily trigger suspicious activity based on the bank s own description of security services and all three used the name and identification of my father the review of the two separate withdrawals included in

that no one from xxxx looked at my account to confirm a check and if they had it would have been automatically recorded digitally xxxx also told me a notarized letter is basically not possible because it would require review by the bank s legal department he suggested that i bring a copy of my account activity to bank of america instead  which i have and the account history showing my check

bank that does not confirm funds for a check  bank of america s back office analysts might still call a  friend  at a local xxxx or xxxx branch and ask them to unofficially confirm funds that fact that bank of america willing breaks other bank s rules is very concerning and might be illegal \n\nxxxx also told me that if i printed out my account activity from xxxx showing that my check cleared and brought it physically to a bank of america branch they would fax it to the back office and review it apparently they are unable to accept emails or conference calls with xxxx  something xxxx at xxxx offered to do to confirm my check for bofa  \n\ni went out of my way to do this on saturday morning xxxxxxxx and the branch manager had no idea what number to fax it to  xxxx told me they would

and cashier s check for 3400 and 600 had been sent to me xxxxxxxx i still have not received the notification letter by mail or the cashier s checks however i did log into my xxxx email tonight which my chase account was connected to and found conflicting emails from them despite all the time i spent with them on the phone xxxxxxxx the email that said they sent me an important letter about my account in  statements and documents  with a link does not open in the my chase console  i have provided a screen grab along with all the emails and the original text message they sent me that i answered  more devastatingly without this account reopened as it is the account linked to my irs payments i am now in limbo for when i may receive the new irs stimulus payment of 140000 \n\ni was told i could contact the irs to change my banking information to my other bank where i have another account to which i informed them that its not possible to change your banking information with the irs until you file your return and that wasnt scheduled to happen until before xxxxxxxx thats why i was keeping this account open with a nominal 4000 balance to process my stimulus payment until my xxxx return was filed and i could update the irs with a new bank for future business \n\nchase claimed they could simply not reopen the account they closed without explanation or notification to receive my irs payment and i scrambled with my accountant yesterday to see if he could file my return early to update the irs with my new banking information for electronic deposits but as stimulus payments are going out this weekend the window for this is practically nonexistent as my accountant hasnt even gotten back to me to let me know if he could get my return done quickly so the irs will deposit my emergency funds into my other bank \n\nive banked with chase for 10 years and this incident along with the aforementioned incident in xxxx of xxxx where they accepted another fraudulent check with a check number exceeding the amount the bank issued me are troubling signs that chase does not have any logical security cross checks in place to automatically identify a fraudulent check that may have their routing and my account number on it from what i am assuming is a data breach with check numbers exceeding the number the bank has issued me \n\nlast year when i deposited a large sum into this same account from a personal injury settlement that my brother represented for me that check cleared his bank on a monday should have reflected in my account on tuesday but wednesday chase was bouncing checks i wrote to pay off associated xxxx debts from the injury and said they had placed a hold on the funds for 2 weeks to clear then they put me on the phone with a representative at chase fraud in an international call center who asked me probing questions about where i got the funds as if i was trying to launder money i told him it was none fo his business where the funds came from but that he should call my brother the attorney s who would inform him it was from a legal settlement he called and my brother told him in no uncertain terms that as my money had cleared his client trust account to my personal checking  the same account they have now closed  that they had better clear the funds immediately and stop bouncing the payments i had made to creditors for my medical bill because he would take action against them and the chase rep then quickly released the hold they do this to make interest off our money its completely unethical and i called the rep out on it and he had the audacity to say  i cant convince you we dont do this to make interest off your money  and i retorted  then who is making interest when you freeze the money for 2 weeks even though ive been banking with you for 10 years and there have been other large sums deposited in that time  chase has proven to be completely derelict in its responsibilities in all three instances i am relaying here and will be creating more instability in my life during this pandemic than is warranted against any customer who has banked with them for so long", "i opened an account with suntrust last week i was getting tired of xxxx xxxx  manipulating transactions on my bank account and figured id just close my account with them and go somewhere else opened my suntrust account online and switched over my direct deposit to them as well as my brokerage account and efts \n\nupon switching bank accounts i also switched insurance companies i informed my new insurance company to autodraft the funds from my new bank account on xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx which i have proof of  the insurance company errored and autodrafted the funds from my account on xxxx xxxx i called my bank and told them about this merchant error and was told to contact the fraud department this wasnt exactly a fraud case so i asked them if i could have any overdrafts fees waved because it wasnt irresponsibility on my part but a merchant error i informed them that i had my first direct deposit scheduled for xxxx xxxx and that it would more than cover the charge the customer service rep told me that i had to wait until the overdraft fee posted in order for them to do anything on the account so i ended the call and waited until the next day xxxx today  \n\nthis morning i wake up and try to log into my account to see if any overdraft fees have been charged i kept getting an error message stating that my log in information was incorrect i was certain that i was putting in the correct information but after a few attempts i decided that id try to reset my password after trying to reset my password i received a message stating that my account was restricted i was also given a number to call to discuss the matter after contacting the listed number i was notified by a customer service rep that my account was being closed i asked why and if it had anything to do with the merchant error that i called about the previous day and was informed that it was due to suntrust bank rules and regulations i asked to speak with a xxxx because i had transferred all of my liquidity over to suntrust bank xxxx brokerage accounts direct deposits and wifes direct deposits  i also got all of my billing set up under eft with suntrust \n\ni was put on hold and transferred to a xxxx who was of no assistance and keep reading from the same script xxxx your account is being closed due to suntrust rules and regulations  i asked if there was anyone above him that i could speak with about my account being closed he said there was no one  as if he was the owner of the bank himself xxxx so i called back and spoke with someone else about the matter only to run into the same brick wall i spoke with their supervisor who told me to speak with my branch xxxx i called my branch xxxx who told me to contact the fraud department to see if they could override it on their end i call the fraud department and ran into get another brick wall xxxx your account is being closed due to suntrust rules and regulations  he puts me on hold to see what he can do for me and nothing i asked to speak with his supervisor and she couldnt do anything by this point im regretting the fact that i even opened an account with suntrust \n\ni end the phone call and call back the fraud department asking if i could speak with a supervisor because you get someone different every time you call i tell yet another supervisor about my situation and still hit a brick wall she tells me that i need to contact my branch xxxx or the area xxxx im infuriated at this point because i have funds due to post to this account tomorrow xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx which i was unable to get reversed because they were already processed now my funds are going to be in the hands of these scam artists who are closing my account without a valid reason \n\ni called my branch xxxx back and told him that the fraud department told me that he was the man i needed to talk to he told me that there was nothing that he could do for me so i asked for the number of the area xxxx he refused to give me the area managers number and hung up on me after thanking me for using suntrust bank i called the customer service line again and was able to retrieve the area managers number i called the area managers office which was closed for the day so xxxx be calling back tomorrow \n\nmeanwhile my money will be swept into a suntrust bank account by tomorrow morning and i will have no access to my funds or account information because my account is being closed due to suntrust rules and regulations \n\nthis process seems rather suspicious ive read countless articles about other consumers with suntrust who have experienced the same thing i have bills that need to be paid and i also need to pay the property tax on a vehicle i just purchased so that i can get it registered my temp tags are due to expire on xxxx xxxx xxxx and i have no access to my funds my wifes car note is due in a few days as well i switched all of my banking to suntrust only to have my account closed for an unspecified reason and now i cant access my funds until they release them to me this is borderline criminal they have nearly 100 xxxx of my money held in their bank and conveniently for them they closed my account before i was able to memorize my account number", "on xxxx xxxx

to get in touch with me if they did i can not afford this payment and have no way to speak with navient about it i feel this is extremely unethical and egregious i am including the email navient sent me on xxxxxxxx stating that they had received my ibr application if there were any problems with my application no one ever contacted me from navient i simply dont believe theyve ever processed my

service rep and had to insist he remove the deferment that was preventing me from signing up for autopay     please add this to the list of practices that are obviously designed to prevent customers from making thoughtful decisions about their loan management and entrap them into years more of debt than they even requested     i also sent a copy of this message to the consumer financial

indicate the reason for the change the difference in the increase amount or that the change was being applied mid billing cycle i simply assumed the change would apply next cycle and that it was a small increment increase or a change in the number of payments \n\ni was shocked when i logged into navient on xxxx to schedule my xxxx payment and saw that i had been assessed late fees on three

helpful and i got error messages more than once forcing me to log back in or refresh the screen i did send two emails through the email link and was sent an automated message that my email would be reviewed i also looked at my xxxx statement and realized that it did list that i was past due and my payment due had jumped from a barely manageable 20000 to an impossible 64000 and that was just on some of my loans not all of them i do not usually look at the statement in depth especially estatements because i log in to the website around the same time each month to make my payment as planned i just like to have them saved for my records \n\nnow i am really concerned because i was under the impression that i was on a longterm repayment plan with the potential for forgiveness if i made all my

calling on xxxx19but they claimed it was too late  as it did not fall within the 30 days after the end of my billing cycle  i had looked at the online agreement which stated i had 60 days after they sent the statement on which to report a problem or error the representative said that did not apply i was sent the relevant agreement to my account again it states i must contact them about a mistake in writing within 60 days after the error appeared on the statement nowhere does it state that any issue or refund request must be requested within 30 days following the end of the billing cycle  in the interim i needed the money and the only way to get it was to pay a 3  fee they were willing to refund the funds if i paid them 22000 so i requested 750000 be direct deposited to my checking account and was charged a 22000 fee onxxxx19", "on thursday xxxxxxxx i logged into my capital one credit accounts and noticed one of my accounts was closed when i contacted customer service to inquire why this had taken place i was told that it was due to inactivity i became very upset especially since this happened to be the oldest credit card i had and closing it would certainly have impact on my credit score  i was then transferred to a supervisor who essentially repeated the same information \nof course i asked if it was possible to reopen the account and i indicated that i would certainly use it but i was told that this was not possible \n\ni found this action to be extremely unprofessional especially given the fact that i have another credit account with capital one for 3000000 which i use very frequently without a single missed payment so i couldnt understand why they would close this smaller account with a significantly smaller limit of 200000 and without providing any notice that this was going to take place it became very obvious after speaking with the supervisor that this was an automatic action that takes place if a card is inactive for a certain  of months im sure this automated action may seem reasonable to whomever devised this system but to not take into consideration the standing of other active accounts or consider the age of the account being closed and how it might impact a clients credit score without any notice is a perfect example of failing to provide basic customer service", "the minimum payment amount for my credit card changed without notification which meant that my scheduled payment did not suffice the minimum i was then charged a late fee for payment and my minimum payment increased again i assume because of this  late payment  all without notification the late fee pushed my balance over my credit limit and the insufficient payment meant my credit score was affected by the  delinquency  during this time before was aware of this situation i applied for a personal loan to consolidate this credit card debt to get a better interest rate and stable monthly payment which would make it easier for me to pay off the debt quickly and was denied because of this  delinquent payment  which i dont have any other history of to my knowledge bank of america does not offer a function which allows for you to just always pay the minimum whatever that may be each month therefore making their automatic bill payment function basically useless also the late fee i was charged without being notified which would have allowed me to rectify the payment amount was more than my minimum payment had been if they had simply notified me of the increased minimum payment amount i could have covered it and avoided all of this", "on xxxxxxxx18 i emailed that xxxx xxxx tried to take the payment from my savings  this has never been authorized i setup the automatic payment to be pulled from my checking which has been pulling until the past couple of months  and that because they pulled from my savings and not my checking that they caused me a 2800 fee from my bank and that now i will be charged a return fee by them \n\ntheir response  you can change the routing or checking account number from which your online credit card payment will be debited the next time you make an online payment simply select  payments  transfers  at the top of the page click the  add a new account link located under the  form  dropdown menu to enter the new designated bank account information once you click  submit  you will have the opportunity to immediately make a payment from the updated information please note your new acct information will not be saved until you make a payment using it if you need further assistance please call us at xxxx or send us an email \n\nmy response through email  you are missing what i said i did not at any time change it to pull from savings i do not want to be charged a late fee by you i also want you to refund the 2800 fee i was charged by my bank you can do the research to see i authorized the payment to automatically be pulled from checking i have never authorized the payment out of savings please let me know when you will be refunding the 2800 if you are not able to i will look to talk to a supervisor and possibly an outside company that can look into the fraud that has taken place", "i

complaint concerns online payment options and specifically recurring  automatic payments \n\nwhen a cardholder makes a onetime payment via chasecom the options include  a pay off your entire statement balance  b pay the minimum payment due or c pay a different amount which the cardholder then specifies\n\nhowever when a cardholder opts for the convenient  automatic payment  which effectively is a recurring payment in which chase drafts the cardholder s checking account every month on a specified date the choices are limited to two  a pay off your entire statement balance  b pay the minimum

infrequently using an automatic recurring payment is in association with a balance transfer which the cardholder wishes to pay off fully before the end of the promotional rate period\n\nchase is fully aware of this issue and its customer service staff default to  if you wish to pay a different amount you can always do a onetime payment  i am certain there is nothing illegal with what chase is doing since they offer alternatives however i am also certain that the drivers of the lack of a  pay a different amount  option on chasecom s automatic payment is to drive  xxxx late fees  to earn something during promotional periods  and to make it difficult for cardholders to automatically pay off balances during promotional periods ensuring a balance rollover at the astronomical 2999  apr\n\nchase has

out here and my husband was super busy with school in the military and wanted me to wait to call our insurance back until he could be with me so i didnt say the wrong thing when i did call they didnt call me back we called the adjuster 3 times our insurance ended up sending us two letters exactly the same one to him and one to me stating that they werent paying for anything due to the fact that i didnt have insurance on my vehicle in wa the other gentleman was getting the payout and that i needed to contact his insurance here s where its convoluted while on the scene wa law states that you

on your credit report the first instance with the original complainant  xxxx  and then come back later and do it again with themselves  afni  ultimately charging you twice for the same thing another thing ive found is that they dont put on the paperwork anything about the vehicles in the accident another thing ive found is that they prefer your checking account info for payments they have a habit of being beligerant towards people when calling and weve experienced this ourselves they also can not get my name correct xxxx  the other gentleman s company  even though they have a copy of my info in two forms has my name incorrect afni has my name a different way but also incorrect as well and this major thing that ive found where i talk about the 6 days to act above is this complaint from the

are in the process of ordering the police report we received the letter xxxxxxxx two months after this purported accident i interrupted the first agent i spoke with and said i would like to go on record as declaring that this was a fraud and she said she would put that on file and hung up interesting second agent i spoke to was a man and he became belligerent with me as i recorded his conversation and told me he would recommend i be quiet or else he was going to file suit against me and contact the state to suspend my driving privileges he told me never to call back again and he also hung up on me i called a third time and spoke with another female agent and i requested to speak with the manager or supervisor i recorded my message with  xxxx  the supervisor and am waiting for

for more than 25 years and have filed numerous cfpb complaints and a complaint with the xxxx there are 2 private loans that originated with xxxx prior to the incorporation of navient in xxxx2010 that did not require payment until my commencement at xxxx due to unforeseeable circumstances i was short the necessary credits to graduate and the college recommended i take a xxxx course unbeknownst to the administration they failed to provide an academic accommodation and incorrectly reporting my enrollment status to the xxxx this led all my loans including those with xxxx to go into immediate repayment without my knowledge while i was still enrolled in school we were never alerted to the schools error and the fact no grace period was ever extended xxxx harassed me and my extended family demanding repayment without explanation xxxx only called to discuss repayment for federal student loan my father made a payment on my behalf for the federal student loans these funds were misapplied by xxxx to private loans instead after payments were made these private loans immediately went into default without my knowledge through research we discovered the enrollment reporting issue made by xxxx that caused these private loans to go into immediate repayment and default navient refuses to accept or acknowledge information provided by the college itself that would declare me half time or more enrolled during the semester that the loans went into repayment navient also fails to acknowledge my correct commencement date they refuse to acknowledge these corrections which would remove the defaults from my credit report navient has not offered any support or resources to resolve the issue they recently resold these loans to a different collection agency xxxx which have contacted family

to multiple discussions with xxxx xxxx then later navient are not eligible for deferment you can get a forbearance on these loans but you have to pay 5000 per loan and to be quite honest i am not even sure i signed up for these type of loans they were not explained to me at all and when i had questions about what i was signing the financial aid advisor rushed me through the process i paid 16000 a month for five years on my private loans on a graduated repayment plan i have been paying  xxxx monthly on my private loans since xxxxxxxx and 13000 on my federal loans when i could no longer defer them i want it noted that i have never once went into default with these loans i want it observed that the total payments i have made on my private loans alone over an 8 year period and in the evidence i have submitted is 1500000 how have i paid almost 1600000 over 8 years \nxxxx uses deceptive recruitment practices to lure students into enrolling to receive their federal financial aid these students receive none of the valuable career skills for which they enrolled in the program and they leave with enormous amounts of debt subsequently they ca nt find a job they default on their loans and taxpayers  dollars are wasted in the process all while these companies continue to profit off of student loan debt and federal financial aid only by my wife and i working together and the grace of a higher power we are not in the situation many people we talk to are in i can not go to a regular school and get an actual valid degree because i simply can not afford to this whole experience has left a devastating impact on me and i am afraid for my own child to go to college \ni will not dispute that i owe the government money i did go to school for two years but i do believe i was deceived about the type of loans i had and the promise of the career path i chose it was all lies and i have paid a heavy price for these lies again over 8 years i have paid almost 1600000 for

during bankruptcy proceeding had went to their deep pockets and they do nt care what methods used to harass us get their money", "for the past few years i have been paying interest on all of my loans and this month is the first month that the loan payments are going into effect paying sallie mae has never been an issue the issue is that i called for them to adjust my payments based on my income  which is 120000 every 2 weeks  well the associate pretty much took the average of my income and the amount of paychecks for the year and stated that i make 260000 a month which is not true there are only two months out of the year in which i get paid 3 times a month which is xxxxxxxx and xxxxxxxx so pretty much for the entire year i make 240000 a month except for those two months anyway so after telling them how much i pay in bills each month the associate has it in her head that i would have 60000 remaining because she believes that i make 260000 each month from this miscalculation  so they pretty much took the amount from those xxxx additional paychecks that i would receive divided it up and added that amount to my monthly income  but in actuality i would only have 40000 a month remaining and they wanted to charge me 34000 a month for the loans which would leave me with 5700 in case of emergencies oil changes or what ever else comes up during the month  then i discovered that i also have federal student loans that would go into effect as well and i wanted to include that amount in my monthly bills and they told me that they do nt include that because they want you to file for forbearance or deferment instead of lowering their payments they know that paying federal student loans is a bill but since the government offers that option they would rather get the customer in more debt than help them out of it i feel as if somewhere this is against the law im sure because i thought that a person could not apply for this unless they truly needed it this should not be an option for another company to advise their customers of so that they can get the most money possible out of the customer so while speaking with the manager and explaining that i was trying to pay both the government and them the guy told me to  shift  my money around because they were doing me a favor and that i was lucky that they were even doing that so at this point i am paying them what i can",

14 years ago on or near xxxxxxxx i have received no communications regarding any student loans since that date from any student loan lender or service company my loans have been 100  paid in full for over 14 years \n\non xxxxxxxx i called aes to attempt to correct their records and demand that they cease invoices for a loan that does not exist \n\ni spoke first with employee  xxxx xxxx who told me she could not help because this was a private loan and there were instructions in their records to direct inquiries to xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx directed me to call xxxx xxxx xxxx at xxxx \n\nxxxx xxxx xxxx  xxxx  told me that xxxx xxxx xxxx  had no record of a loan for me and that this was an aes issue referring me back to the general number for aes \n\ni then called aes and spoke with xxxx  xxxx who claimed she could not help me and referred me to xxxx  xxxx who referred me to xxxx  xxxx who ultimately informed me that there had been a problem with aes collections recently and that i had been billed in error xxxx told me that the original lender was xxxx never xxxx xxxx and that apparently some stale borrower lists had been sent recently to aes in error and my notice was a mistake xxxx also told me theyd had the same issue with many other erroneous letters and collections based on flawed stale lists xxxx told me not to worry about it that it would  work itself out  and no further action was required by me \n\ni asked for the xxxx contact number so i could verify that their records confirmed payment in full my concern was that erroneous records and billing could result in filing of negative credit reports xxxx gave me the number xxxx for xxxx which i then called \n\nxxxx looked up my account number and informed me that their records did show a loan for that account number but it had been paid in full on xxxxxxxx this is the same date shown on the new bills from aes as  last payment received  \n\nxxxx advised me that this bill was clearly a mistake by aes and the fact that id not received any bills since xxxxxxxx should be sufficient proof that it had been paid in full xxxx also said it would  work itself out  and i needed to do nothing further but that it was

alleged loan within 2 weeks when i had already called to dispute and been told  dont worry about it no action needed  \n\ni called aes and spoke with xxxx  xxxx who said that she could not answer any questions about the account i explained the history on this matter and requested immediate resolution xxxx said she couldnt answer any questions and  just answered the phone  and wanted to transfer my call after the literal hours i spent on xxxxxxxx i was reluctant to be shoveled to yet another uninformed and unhelpful person after several insistent requests as to where exactly she intended to transfer my call xxxx told me she would be referring me to the  student loans department  which is odd since the whole business purpose of aes is  student loans  so when one calls the number on the  student loan  bill does one not reach anyone who deals with  student loans  i agreed to be transferred and xxxx  xxxx took my call \n\nxxxx told me that this alleged loan was a pheaa loan but then retracted that statement and agreed it appeared to be a xxxx loan he alleged that payments were made on this loan as late as xxxxxxxx which is false xxxx also claimed that there is yet another loan

information i had gathered from all my calls i requested that aes  1  cease collection on this nonexistent loan  2  provide evidence that any debt is substantiated  3  suspend all internal action

the phone attempting to track down anyone who could competently address and resolve this ridiculous debt collection for alleged loans which have been paid in full for nearly 15 years there are several recent court cases in which aes has been found to have poor and insufficient records unsubstantiated debts and collection practices in violation of federal law it is beyond ridiculous that any consumer is put in the position of having to spend hours of valuable time to correct records on a 15 year old debt paid in full and it is unconscionable that any financial institution has the power to wage a collection campaign and record false allegations of nonpayment without a court order \n\ni request that the cfpb investigate my own issue and by extension what according to aes s own employees  statements to me is a large scale case of a mistaken collection campaign it is conceivable that for certain small amounts like mine aes is intentionally using scare tactics to collect on nonexistent loans from many people who like me can not or do not want to spend the time dredging up records languishing on  hold  and dealing with tens of layers of anonymous internal bureaucracy additionally i will want to know the statute of limitations on collection for a loan like this it is as employee xxxx xxxx said evidence enough that i had xxxx communications from any loan service since xxxxxxxx \n\naes is at best willfully ignorant and mismanaged and at worst engaged in a large scale fraudulent collection practice using their power as a financial institution to threaten individuals into paying amounts they do not owe without any basis in fact or evidence because lending institutions have the power to impact credit reports without warning or meaningful citizen recourse and thus all

your assistance in order to 1  reverse the interest assessed for missing the expiration of the promotional period due to lack of noticeand clear statement messaging and 2  assess the confusing payment system as a mitigating factor again td argued i set it up to pay 15000 per month but i set the autopay feature to pay the full amount due each month which has consistently drawn my account for more than 15000 i fully expected that any monthly draw would include any promotional balance due for the period based on how i set up the payment in their system\n\nmy experience with the td card rises to the level of deceptive and misleading with respect to the expiration of the promotional period coupled with the complete lack of transparency in the automated payment system if anything these practices are designed to prevent consumers from paying promotional balances especially compared to industry peer such as xxxx", "we purchase a ring in xxxx xxxx for the amount of xxxx last xxxx xxxx

in the past several years i thought the payments that i was making was being applied towards the interest free promotions but recently found out that is not an automatic transaction from that point forward i made payments waited for the check to clear my bank and then i called customer service to have the payment applied how i wanted it applied i look at the credit card statement every single month and have spoken to many representatives over the past few months the call that i placed on xxxxxxxx was the first time a representative advised me that there is a minimum due on another promotional purchase this particular purchase was originally approximately 1700000 in xxxxxxxx the promotion is interest of 799  until paid off the statement clearly states until paid off the statement does not say anywhere that there is a minimum amount that has to be applied to that balance first and the statement does not say what that minimum amount is i have had enough of confusing statements and my promotions expiring so i have stayed on top of my recent promotion purchases i made a call to customer service in xxxx to have the latest payment applied i was given a payoff amount for each payment and made that payment in xxxx i was shocked to see that my xxxx statement included interest even though i had made every attempt to get it paid off on time i called customer service and the representative told me that if i made a payment of 22000 plus 22000 that would satisfy the mimimal due on the promotion of xxxxxxxx as well as the two purchases of xxxxxxxx without the payment by xxxxxxxx we will be charged interest on the interest free promotion i made a payment on xxxxxxxx in the store and it cleared the bank yesterday i called customer service today to ask them to apply the payment so that it pays off the interest free promotions the representative informed me that i had other promotional interest free promotions that the payments was applied to instead of the ones i had wanted it to i was told that if i make an additional 12000 payment by xxxxxxxx they can apply that payment to the upcoming expiring interest free promotions \n\nthis is an ongoing issue xxxx bank is unable to send me a printout of how the payments are allocated the terms are not found anywhere on there statement other than the current balance original price date of purchase and when promotion expires i can not find anywhere on any statements where it says how much of a minimal amount is due on the fixed pay reduced apr promotion of 799  the statements are confusing and customer service representatives are also confusing not to mention i dont understand why i have to contact them monthly to have payments applied this forces me to spend too much time attempting to avoid interest and then i find out that all my time doesnt matter they just want more money my minimal amount due on xxxxxxxx was supposed to be 28000 i sent a check for 45000 and now they want 12000 more needless to say i find this all suspect and confusing i think they should be forced to do a better job in writing to inform consumers how much the minimum is due on the promotions and how the payments will be applied", "i requested verification since xxxx2021 of this alleged debt that this company claimed i owe which they reported on my credit files however discover financial servi failed to obtain the
